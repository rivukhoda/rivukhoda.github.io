    <h3>End is near</h3>
    <p>
        Inspired by my brother's grief in having to play the trombone throughout his highschool,
        this original piece is meant to represent the psychological conflict of being forced to play the trombone
        even thought guitar is the desirable instrument one wants to play. Due to the strictly regulated economics of a
        highschool
        music program, the student ends up enduring several years of anger, jealously, humiliation and hopelessness
        of not being able to change his principle instrument. However, even thought the fate of playing the trombone has
        been sealed by the time it was graduation, a little hope begins to emerge for those in the brass section (not
        the sax players) that perhaps we can shine in the end.

    <h3>Daughters</h3>
    <p>Originally written by John Mayer, I decided to cover this song as a way to introduce myself to vocals after
        having played guitar for a few years. Having gone through the oreal, I now believe that every guitarist
        should learn how to accompany themselves singing. Since it made me realize how important triads and "smaller" chord
        structures are, how important dynamic is, and just how annoying guitars can be for those who sing.
